                The 5 COMPONENTS OF S.M.A.R.T. GOALS
                The S.M.A.R.T. Goals approach is designed to provide the guidelines that will assist you in developing the fitness and lifestyle changes you desire. The components address five aspects of goals that you are taking effective and efficient steps towards an improved quality of life. In essence goals should be:



                Specific:

                It is important that your fitness goals be as specific as possible. You will need to address those aspects of health & fitness that are not quite up to speed.  Improving elements such as aerobic fitness, muscle strength & endurance, flexibility, coordination, body composition, and healthy eating habits should be the focus of goal setting.

                Simply planning to lose weight, look better, or become more fit does not pinpoint your objectives to a degree that allows for a specific plan of action, and tends to leave you wondering, “Where do I begin?”

                Choosing specific goals enables you and your fitness professional to plan a course of action that has detailed objectives that can later be reevaluated for efficacy.  Your goals, as well as the means by which they are attained must be specific.



                Measurable:

                Effective goals are measurable. How much weight do I want to lose? What would I like my body fat percentage to be? When would I like to be able to fit in that dress? How much weight do I want to bench press.  How many more fruits and vegetables do I want to add to my diet? Asking these types of questions will help you create a quantifiable list of intentions that can be pursued and later evaluate in order to chart progress.
